# ðŸ§ª Group 9 â€“ Prostate Cancer Data Exploration (Simulacrum Challenge)

Welcome to our collaborative project for the **Health Data Science Technical Challenge**.  
This repository contains all code, notebooks, and documentation for the analysis of **prostate cancer (ICD-10: C61)** using synthetic health data from the **Simulacrum** dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project investigates synthetic patient records of **prostate cancer** cases generated by the Simulacrum tool. Our goal is to explore patterns, insights, and limitations of the data and present findings suitable for a healthcare-informed audience with limited knowledge of cancer.

### Objectives:
- Understand the structure and variables within the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify trends, patterns, and correlations
- Communicate findings visually and clearly
- Highlight the datasetâ€™s reliability and limitations
