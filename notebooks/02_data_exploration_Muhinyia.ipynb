    "## Data Structure\n",
    "The Simulacrum v2 is made up of synthetic versions of the following datasets, held on the CAS:\n",
    "#### 1. National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD)\n",
    "-  Information about all patients diagnosed with a cancer in years 2016-2019 and their\n",
    "tumour diagnoses\n",
    "-  Patient and tumour tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) datasets\n",
    "-  Information about all systemic anti-cancer therapy treatments received by patients\n",
    "-  Regimen, cycle, drug detail and outcome tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS)\n",
    "- Information about all radiotherapy treatments received by patients\n",
    "- Prescription and exposure tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Somatic genetic testing data\n",
    "-  Information about somatic tests performed on patients’ tumours\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-level description of data files\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **sim_av_patient** — Patient-level info, e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc.; each row is a patient—identifier _PATIENTID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **sim_av_tumor** — Tumor-level info, e.g., cancer site, stage, and date of diagnosis, etc. (only for PRIMARY cancers); each row is a cancer tumor—identifier _TUMOURID_. (A patient can have more than one tumor record). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **sim_sact_regimen** - Each SACT patient is assigned to a predetermined treatment plan that comprises at least one regimen. A _PATIENTID_ would show which patient is undertaking what regimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **sim_sact_cycle** - A regimen will be given across multiple cycles. This table reflects the frequency with which the course of treatment is repeated and the rest periods between administrations. A cycle links to a regimen through _MERGED_REGIMEN_ID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **sim_sact_drug_detail** - Records details about each drug administered within a cycle, e.g., dosage and method of delivery. A detail linked to a cycle through _MERGED_CYCLE_ID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **sim_sact_outcome** - Records the outcome of a particular regimen that was undertaken (which was completed or changed). The outcome could be, e.g., modified or stopped early. An outcome linked to a regimen via _MERGED_REGIMEN_ID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><b>Note</b></u>\n",
    "\n",
    "A patient will often have one regimen per line of treatment, with multiple cycles recorded for the regimen and multiple drug administrations per cycle. However, this may not be the case. For example, it is known that:\n",
    "- (i) some oral drugs are incorrectly prescribed as a single cycle for the duration of treatment.\n",
    "- (ii) cycles for some regimens can become split and submitted as multiple different regimens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This latter issue is understood to be more pronounced in earlier years prior to trusts adopting robust e-prescribing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **sim_rtds_episode** - Each row is a separate episode, which is delivered over one or more appointments, i.e., each row is a separate episode-appointment. An episode will involve a single prescription of radiotherapy or more than one prescription sometimes. Episodes are linked to the patients through _PATIENTID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **sim_rtds_presicription** — A radiotherapy prescription relates to a series of identical doses of treatments to a single anatomical site. One prescription will be delivered over the course of one or more appointments, with one data row per unique prescription-appointment combination. Prescriptions can be for either teletherapy or Brachytherapy treatment. This table includes information on the anatomical site that received radiotherapy treatment if a patient has metastatic disease, the radiotherapy dose, and the treatment region.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **sim_rtds_exposure** - At each appointment for a prescription, patients receive a number of treatment exposures, where each exposure is the delivery of one radiotherapy beam. Each row is an exposure. An exposure could be a non-treatment one where a machine is switched on for treatment verification, or it could be a treatment one, i.e., dosimetry. Exposure relates to the patient via _PATIENT_ID_. Exposure has a one-to-many relationship with prescriptions via _PRESCRIPTIONID_, _RADIOTHERAPYEPISODEID_, _ATTENDID_, _LINKCODE_ and _PATIENTID_.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **sim_rtds_combined** - A combination of **sim_rtds_episode**, **sim_rtds_prescription** and **sim_rtds_exposure**. The table has one data row per exposure and contains all variables from across all the RTDS tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **sim_av_gene** - Contains information about molecular tests for somatic (acquired) changes in a tumour’s genetic material at the gene level. Each row represents a unique combination of TUMOURID and a tested gene/chromosome. Although multiple tests may be performed on a tumour gene, each gene will appear only once per tumor. Includes information on the type and date of test and test results for each gene tested. Where multiple tests have occurred, a hierarchy has been applied to report the test with the earliest\n",
    "most definitive result. Genes arw linked to tumours in **sim_av_tumour** by _TUMOURID_.\n",
