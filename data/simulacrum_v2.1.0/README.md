# 📁 Data Folder

The simulacrum dataset files are **not stored** in this repository due to file size limitations.

👉 Access the shared dataset here:  
🔗 [Google Drive – Group 9 Prostate Cancer Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8UfSTsaS1U2G4RiHyCT6BHID6FLxvpH?usp=drive_link)

To work with the data in Google Colab:
1. Add the shared folder to your own Google Drive.
2. Mount your Drive in Colab using:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Then load the dataset using its full file path.

📌 Please do not upload `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or other large files directly to this folder.
